# Double Kettlebell Jerk Program

## Accessory Rotation
- **Mon:** Push-ups to strong fatigue (stop 1–2 reps before absolute failure)
- **Wed:** Front squats (2×20 kg = 8–10RM, 2×24 kg = 3–5RM)
- **Fri:** Ring pull-ups (BW = 8RM, +12 kg = 3–4RM)

## Program

- Prep: 2x20kg Ronin (3 phases) 6 + 4 + 4 wks

| Phase | Length | Main Work | Short Sessions (21′ / 27′ / 35′) | Long Sessions (30′ / 36′ / 44′) | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **1. Power (current weight)** | 4–12 wks | EMOM, 3 reps/set | ~21 / ~27 / ~35 sets → 63 / 81 / 105 reps | ~30 / ~36 / ~44 sets → 90 / 108 / 132 reps | Focus on snap & timing, no missed reps; crisp rack every time |
| **2. Density / Hypertrophy (current weight)** | 6–12 wks | 6–8 reps/set, steady pace (not EMOM) | Start ~50–60% of Power sets, build toward ~90% capacity; e.g. 11→18 sets in 21′ day | Start ~50–60% of Power sets, build toward ~90% capacity; e.g. 15→27 sets in 30′ day | Gradually add sets until long day can sustain 7–8 reps/set without breakdown |
| **3. New Weight Introduction (sets of 1)** | 4–8 wks | 2×24 kg (double or unilateral), 1–2 reps/set | 8–12 / 10–14 / 12–18 sets → singles or doubles | 12–16 / 14–20 / 16–24 sets → singles or doubles | Mon: unilateral jerks (alt arms); Wed: doubles; Fri: mix doubles/singles; full rest between |
| **4. Strength (new weight)** | 8–12 wks | 1–5 reps/set, 2–3 wks per rep target | 8–12 / 10–14 / 12–18 sets | 12–16 / 14–20 / 16–24 sets | Rest fully, focus on quality lifts; stay in one rep target long enough to adapt |
| **5. Power (new weight)** | 4–12 wks | EMOM, 3 reps/set | ~21 / ~27 / ~35 sets → 63 / 81 / 105 reps | ~30 / ~36 / ~44 sets → 90 / 108 / 132 reps | Rebuild speed & density; stop sets before form degradation |

### How to Read the Table
- **Short version** = 21′ / 27′ / 35′
- **Long version** = 30′ / 36′ / 44′
- “Sets” column = number of *sets of jerks* to fit in that time frame.
- Multiply **sets × reps per set** (phase rep target) to get total reps for the session.
