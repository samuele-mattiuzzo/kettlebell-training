## HIRT for Hypertrophy
```
- The burn.
Complete 25 heavy kettlebell swings (40-48kg for strong gentlemen; 20-24kg for strong ladies).
These swings should be as powerful as possible.
Once completed shake it off for a minute or two before starting the exercises you do in your ‘rest’ period.


- Ten minutes of rest.
Between sets of swings, you will do presses.
You want your presses to be crisp and powerful. Please don’t grind out your last rep. Leave a rep in the tank on each set. Try to do three sets in that ten minutes:
Minute 2: 7-8 reps at 65% of 1RM
Minute 4: 3 reps at 85% of 1RM
Minute 7: 5-6 reps at 75% of 1RM

Do this program three days a week.
Do low (3 rounds), medium (4 rounds), and heavy (5 rounds) volume throughout the week on this program.
On other training days, you can weight train with squats and pull-ups if doing swings and presses.

You will want to use the above hypertrophy program with one upper and one lower body choice. On alternate days, train the other body movements normally.
Please avoid other glycolytic (the burn) types of exercises while on this program.

Maintain this program for six weeks. Alternate between it and traditional HIRT training to maintain your gains and to keep progressing.
