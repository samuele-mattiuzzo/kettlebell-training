# Kettlebell Axe

- Train 2x week (Monday/Thursday), sometimes add a 3rd day on Saturday
- Complete the sets within 15/20 minutes (OTM, 1.5 mins rest max, no less than 45'')
- Heavy, low-rep sets on the minute
  
- Pick one of the pulls
  - 2H swing
  - 1H swing
  - Hand-to-Hand swing (preferred)
  - Snatch
- Each rep must be given at least 80% effort
- Stop signs: speed drop, tempo drop, technique fail, muscle burn

- 10-20RM Kettlebell, start with 10-20 sets
  - start with sets of 4 reps
  - if <10 sets decrease the reps per set to 2
  - if >20 sets increase the reps per set to 6
  - adjust +2/-2
 
- GOAL: 30 sets with given weight and rep count
- Step progression: stay with the same sets/reps till rpe goes from 8 to 7
- Progression: (2)/4/6 -> 10-20 to 30 -> +(8)/4kg and start over (sets of two are for big weight jumps)
- Every other week replace AXE session with Double Espresso: 1 set every 30''
