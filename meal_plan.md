1. **Fasted Morning Training**: Since you train around 6 a.m., we'll prioritize **protein-rich post-workout meals** (after your workout, around 9/9:15 a.m.) to kickstart recovery.
   
2. **Pre-workout (Optional)**: If you're already using a pre-workout supplement, this is fine for fasted training. No additional adjustments needed here unless you want to add **BCAAs** or **EAAs** (Essential Amino Acids) to preserve muscle while fasting.

3. **Meal Timing Adjustments**: 
   - **First meal at 9/9:15 a.m.** will focus on **high protein** and potentially some **moderate carbs** (on strength days) for recovery.
   - **Dinner at 8 p.m.** will stay as the last major meal of the day, keeping protein and fats higher to keep you satiated overnight.

### **How to Eat on Different Training Days**:

1. **Strength Training Days (Complexes/Kettlebell Work)**:
   - **First meal (post-workout)**: Include **moderate carbs** (like oats or small amounts of fruit) to help replenish glycogen and support muscle recovery.
   - **Protein**: ~150-160g from animal sources.
   - **Fats**: Moderate to high (~90-100g) to provide satiety and energy for muscle recovery.

2. **Active Recovery Days (Swings, Burpees, A+A)**:
   - **Focus on protein and fats** with almost no carbs (<10g).
   - **Protein**: ~150g to maintain muscle.
   - **Fats**: Keep them high (~90-100g) to fuel your body without carbs.

3. **Rest Days (PSMF)**:
   - **Very high protein**: ~180-200g from lean sources (egg whites, whey, lean meats).
   - **Minimal fats and carbs**: Very low fat (~30-40g) and carbs (<10g).
   - These days will create a **calorie deficit** for fat loss while preserving muscle.

### **Will This Help with Love Handles?**
Yes, the combination of:
- **High protein** to preserve muscle,
- **Low carbs** to encourage fat loss,
- **Calorie cycling** (higher on training days, lower on rest days),
- And **consistent training** (strength-focused complexes and active recovery)

will promote **fat loss**, especially around stubborn areas like the waistline. Sticking to the plan will ensure muscle
