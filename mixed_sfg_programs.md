## The Triple Gear Squat Protocol

```
Protocol 1:
- Lift three times a week with the same weight and sets/rep scheme
    Monday â€” fast, touch-and-go without jerking, explode up
    Wednesday - medium, comfortable pace
    Friday - slow, like a hard/heavy PR
- Use 6-10RM -> 5 sets x 50% reps, 15 total reps
- Rest appropriately (~2/3 minutes)
- 5 weeks long
```

```
Protocol 2:
- Lift three times a week with the different weight, intensity and reps/set scheme
- Two week types: A and B
