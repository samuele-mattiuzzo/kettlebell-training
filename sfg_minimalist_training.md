### The setup

- Pairs: Push/Hinge and Squat/Pull

- Numbers:
  - ballistics (A+A)
    - pick a weight that allows 10/15+ reps
    - start with 5 reps OTM / O2M and work up to 100 reps
    - add +1 rep each week
    - once reps go from 5 to 10 up the weight

  - grinds (russian ladders)
    - select a specific RM based on goal (5RM = strength, 10RM = hypertrophy, 15RM = endurance)
    - ladder:
      - rung A = 2/3 of RM (rounded)
      - rung C = 1/3 of RM (rounded)
      - rung B = rung1 - rung2
      - 10RM example = 7,4,3 | 5RM example = 3,2,1
    - start with 2x(A,B,C)
    - each week add +1 rep to each ladder alternating for 6 weeks (till RM is reached)
      - 10RM example: (743,743) -> (854,743) -> (854,854) -> (965,854) -> (965,965) -> (1076,965) -> 2x(1076) -> retest


### The days

- One pair a day, 6 days a week
or

- DAY 1
HEAVY:PUSH/HINGE
LIGHT:PULL/SQUAT
DAY 2
MEDIUM:PUSH/HINGE
LIGHT:PULL/ SQUAT
DAY3
HEAVY:PULL/SQUAT
LIGHT:PUSH/HINGE
Where heavy stand for the actual progression with the loads, medium a 10% almost back off on the weight, light a 20%.
