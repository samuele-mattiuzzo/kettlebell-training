```

### Plan A

```
  - Train twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.
  - Train the single kettlebell LCC&J with your weaker arm’s 6-12RM.
  - Do a set every 30sec: left on the top ofthe minute and right 30sec into it.
  - Start with single reps (1C+1J). Carry on until you cannot pass the talk test right before the next set.
    Let sets fluctuate.
  - When you make it to 30min—30sets per arm -> add a second clean to each set (C+J+C)
  - When you make it to 30min-30sets per arm -> add a second jerk (C+J+C+J).
  - Keep adding till you reach 3 C+J left + 3 C+J right (180 reps in 30 minutes)
  - Every 4th week: deload with lower kettlebell size, maintain last session's parameters
```

### Plan B
```
  - Train cleans on Mondays and jerks on Thursdays.
  - Use 6-12RM of your weaker arm LC for both exercises.
  - Do a set every 30sec: left on the top ofthe minute and right 30sec into it.
  - Start with sets of 3 reps. Build up to 30min (180 total reps, the sum of both arms).
  - Switch to sets of 4 reps and build up to 30min (240 total reps, the sum of both arms).
  - Finally, sets of 5 reps up to 30min (300 total reps, the sum of both arms). 
  - Every 4th week: deload with lower kettlebell size, maintain last session's parameters
```

## Advanced Training(Double Kettlebell Clean & Jerk)

The advanced training template differs from the intermediate one in only two details: 
 
 - Cleans and jerks are done with two kettlebells, not one.
 - A set is done every minute.

### Plan 2A

```
  - Train the double long cycle clean-and-jerktwice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.
  - Train the LCwith your 6-12RM. Start with a single rep (1C+1J) on the minute.
  - Add a rep of one exercise once you have reached 30min: C-J C-J-C C-J-C-J C-J-C-J-C C-J-C-J-C-J
  - Target: 3C+J every minute for 30 minutes
  - Then retest your RM and switch to Plan 2B.
  - Every 4th week: deload with lower kettlebell size, maintain last session's parameters
```

### Plan 2B

```
  - Train cleans on Mondays and jerks on Thursdays.
  - Use 6-12RM of your LC for both exercises.
  - Do sets OTM. Fail talk test -> done for the day
  - Start with sets of 3reps. Build up to 30min (90 total reps).
  - Switch to sets of 4 reps. Build up to 30min (120 total reps).
  - Switch to sets of 5 reps. Build up to 30min (150total reps). 
  - Every fourth week deload in the same manner as in Plan 2A (lighter kettlebells, same volume and density).
