# StrongFirst PLAN A + PLAN B


### Preparation
```
3-5 sets of 3-5 reps, medium weight

EXAMPLES

1.Warm-up of choice
2.Clean—3 sets of 5 reps per arm
3.Rib grab and “Brettzel”
4.Long push press—3 sets of 3 reps per arm
5.Clean—2 sets of 5 reps per arm 
6.Push press—5 sets of 3 reps per arm
7.Stretch and cool-down


1.Warm-up of choice
2.Clean—2 sets of 5 reps per arm
3.“Brettzel” and pullup bar stretches
4.Long push press—1 set of 3 reps per arm
5.Push press—1 set of 3 reps per arm
6.Jerk—5 sets of 3 reps per arm
7.Long cycle—5 sets of 3 reps per arm
8.Stretch and cool-down
```

### Plan A

```
  - Train twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.
  - Train the single kettlebell LCC&J with your weaker arm’s 6-12RM.
  - Do a set every 30sec: left on the top ofthe minute and right 30sec into it.
  - Start with single reps (1C+1J). Carry on until you cannot pass the talk test right before the next set. Let sets fluctuate.
  - When you make it to 30min—30sets per arm—the next training day add a second clean to each set (C+J+C)
  - When you make it to 30min with an extra clean, next training day add a second jerk (C+J+C+J).
  - Keep adding till you reach 3 C+J left + 3 C+J right (180 reps in 30 minutes)
  - Every 4th week: deload with lower kettlebell size, maintain last session's parameters
```

### Plan B
```
  - Train cleans on Mondays and jerks on Thursdays.
  - Use 6-12RM of your weaker arm LC for both exercises.
  - Do a set every 30sec: left on the top ofthe minute and right 30sec into it.
  - Start with sets of 3 reps. Build up to 30min (180 total reps, the sum of both arms).
  - Switch to sets of 4 reps and build up to 30min (240 total reps, the sum of both arms).
  - Finally, sets of 5 reps up to 30min (300 total reps, the sum of both arms). 
  - Allow the two exercises to progress at their own rate. When the progress in one of the exercises stalls, retest your LC RM and switch back to plan A. 
  - Every 4th week: deload with lower kettlebell size, maintain last session's parameters
```

## Advanced Training(Double Kettlebell Clean & Jerk)

The advanced training template differs from the intermediate one in only two details: 
 
 - Cleans and jerks are done with two kettlebells, not one.
 - A set is done every minute.

### Plan 2A

```
  - Train the double long cycle clean-and-jerktwice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.
  - Train the LCwith your 6-12RM. Start with a single rep (1C+1J) on the minute.
  - Add a rep of one exercise once you have reached 30min: C-J C-J-C C-J-C-J C-J-C-J-C C-J-C-J-C-J
  - Use the same two-step procedure (+ clean, then + jerk) until you either reach three LCC&J repetitions every minute (90 reps of each) or your progress stalls.
  - Then retest your RM and switch to Plan 2B.
  - Every 4th week: deload with lower kettlebell size, maintain last session's parameters
```

### Plan 2B
•Train double cleans and jerks on separate days. Train cleans on Mondays and jerks on Thursdays.
•Use 6-12RM of your LC for both exercises.
•Do sets OTM. You must keep passing the talk test before the next set.Once you have failed the talk test, you are done for the day.
•Start with sets of 3reps. Build up to 30min(90 total reps). Then switch to sets of 4. Again build up to 30min (120 total reps). Finally, switch to sets of 5 reps and workup to 30min (150total reps). 
•Allow the two exercises to progress at their own rate. When the progress in one of the exercises stalls, retest your LC RM and switch back to plan 2A. 
•Every fourth week deload in the same manner as in Plan 2A (lighter kettlebells, same volume and density). Do the same if you are feeling very tired on any given Monday or Thursday.The C&J Weight TargetsThe following weights are to become your working weights for plans 2A and 2B.Men—80% BW in the double kettlebell long cycleWomen—40% BW (but no morethan 28kg/62lb) in the single4kettlebell long cycle.
