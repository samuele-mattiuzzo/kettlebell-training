# The Lockdown Monolith

All credit to Jim Wendler as this is basically a rip off of Building the Monolith using the limited range of workout equipment I have at home.

# The tools:

- Kettlebells in 2x16kg, 2x20kg, 1x24kg, 1x32kg

- Pullup/chins + dips bars / towers

- Resistance bands

- Ab wheel

If you distill Building the Monolith down you can look at it as waved progression for the big lifts med/easy/hard, whilst building a ton of volume with accessories.

# Warm up
```
3 rounds, mostly taken from simple & sinister

25x band pull aparts
5x prying squats
5x 3-second glute bridges
5x halos
```

# Monday
Volume squat

- 5x5 double kettlebell front squats with imbalanced bells (eg 20&24).
  Warm up would be goblet squats, then double front squats. Tried to increase reps over time.

- Intensity kettlebell press.
  Work up to a PR set in the 5-10 rep range then drop back one bell -> AMRAP.

- Pull ups build up to 100

- Dips 100-200

- Kettlebell swings 100 (band face pulls if too fatigued from chinups)
