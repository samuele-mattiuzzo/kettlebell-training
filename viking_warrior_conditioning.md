### THE CMVO2 TEST

```
Snatch 16kg, 5 minutes

1st minute: 10 reps, or 1 rep per 6.0 seconds 
2nd minute: 14 reps, or 1 rep per 4.2 seconds 
3rd minute: 18 reps, or 1 rep per 3.3 seconds 
4th minute: 22 reps, or 1 rep per 2.7 seconds 
5th minute: All out, or as many reps as possible
```

### The 15:15 protocol

```
Multiple sets of 15'' snatch followed by 15'' active rest
Goal: 80 work sets before moving onto 36:36 (7-9 reps in 15'')
Work/rest ratio: 1:1
Cadence: 5th minute CMVO2 set divided by 4 (round up)

Eg: 5th minute, 28 reps -> 7 reps cadence sets
```

### The 36:36 protocol

```
Multiple sets of 36'' snatch followed by 36'' active rest
Goal: 35 work sets before moving onto 36:36 (7-9 reps in 15'')
Work/rest ratio: 1:1
Cadence: 5th minute CMVO2 set divided by 10, multiplied by 6 (round up)

Eg: 5th minute, 28 reps -> 2.8 * 6 -> 17 reps cadence sets
```

### THE MVO2 BOOST PROTOCOL

```
14 session peaking plan
Goal:
Work/rest ratio:
Cadence: 5th minute CMVO2 test reps + 2

Eg: 5th minute, 28 reps -> 7 + 2 reps per set

Sessions 1,2,3:
   - 3x15'' L + 15'' R (45'' rest) + 3x30'' L + 30'' R (90'' rest)

Sessions 4,5:
   - 4x15'' L + 15'' R (45'' rest) + 4x30'' L + 30'' R (90'' rest)

Sessions 6,7,8:
   - 5x15'' L + 15'' R (45'' rest) + 5x30'' L + 30'' R (90'' rest)

Sessions 9,10,11:
   - 6x15'' L + 15'' R (45'' rest) + 6x30'' L + 30'' R (90'' rest)

Sessions 12,13,14:
   - 7x15'' L + 15'' R (45'' rest) + 7x30'' L + 30'' R (90'' rest)
```

###Â THE LAT PROTOCOL

```
Snatch test:
  - <200 reps in 10' -> +50% reps
  - 200-215 reps in 10' -> +45% reps
  - 216-230 reps in 10' -> +40% reps
  - 231-245 reps in 10' -> +35% reps
  - >245 reps in 10' -> +30% reps

Goal:
  - start with 1:2 work rest ratio (1 minute work, 2 minutes rest etc)
  - when 15 sets are achieved, reduce rest to 1:1.5
  - when 13-15 sets are achieved, retest
```
